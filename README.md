<h1 align="center">Welcome to push_swap 👋</h1>
<p>🪫 The objective of this project is quite simple, sort data. You have at your disposal a set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks.

> One of the evalutaions was done wrong (69%, 109%, 109%), so my final grade should have been 109%

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/peguimasid/42-PushSwap.git push_swap
```

## Usage

1. Run `make` to compile program

2. Run the program passing the numbers to sort

```sh
./push_swap 89 34 67 23 8 3 678 9
```

## Bonus

1. Run `make bonus` to compile the program

2. Run the mandatory program sending the same numbers to `./checker` to see if the instructions really sort the numbers

```sh
./push_swap 89 34 67 23 8 3 678 9 | ./checker 89 34 67 23 8 3 678 9
```
